# Lab-Fees

[With Devon and Aliyah]

Combined identical columns, obtained measures of central tendency (mean, median, mode, range), counted nonmissing values, and identified outliers via standard deviation for lab and diagnostic fees of 40+ govt hospitals.

Mostly used for loops but would have been more efficient instead with user-defined functions.
